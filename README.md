# ReactMovieApp

## Description

ReactMovieApp is a web application that allows users to discover and search for movies. It utilizes the TMDB API to fetch movie data and provides a user-friendly interface for browsing trending movies and searching for specific titles. The application is built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Appwrite for backend services.

**This application is live at: [https://mhtbtanvir.github.io/ReactMovieApp/](https://mhtbtanvir.github.io/ReactMovieApp/)**

## Technologies Used

*   React
*   JavaScript
*   Tailwind CSS
*   Vite
*   Appwrite
*   TMDB API

## Setup/Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mhtbtanvir/ReactMovieApp.git
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd react-app
    ```

3.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your TMDB API key:

    ```
    VITE_TMDB_API_KEY=YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY
    ```

    Replace `YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY` with your actual TMDB API key. You can obtain one from [https://www.themoviedb.org/](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

5.  Configure Appwrite:

    *   Set up an Appwrite account and create a new project.
    *   Create a database and a collection in Appwrite.
    *   Add * as  platform in your Appwrite project settings (Platforms -> Add Web App). This is crucial for CORS to work correctly.Gave me a hard time as this           was my first deploy.
    *   Update the `src/appwrite.js` file with your Appwrite project ID, database ID, and collection ID.

## Usage

1.  Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```


3.  Browse trending movies on the homepage.

4.  Use the search bar to find specific movies by title.
